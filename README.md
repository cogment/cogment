[Cogment](https://cogment.ai) enables AI researchers and engineers to build, train, and operate AI agents in simulated or real environments shared with humans. Developed by [AI Redefined](https://ai-r.com), Cogment is the first open source platform designed to address the challenges of continuously training humans and AI together. For the full user documentation visit <https://docs.cogment.ai>

This repository includes the the main Cogment module, a multi-platform stand alone CLI including:

- The **orchestrator** service, the heart of Cogment, it executes the trials involving actors and environments by orchestrating the different user implemented services.
- The **trial datastore** service, that is able to store and make available the data generated by the trials.
- The **model registry** service, that let's user store AI models and make them available to actor implementations during training and in production.
- The **init** tool to bootstrap cogment project locally (Deprecated).
- The **run** tool to define and run commands within a cogment project (Deprecated).

## Installation

### Standalone binary (preferred)

Download the install script and make sure you can run it using

```console
curl --silent -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogment/cogment/main/install.sh --output install-cogment.sh
chmod +x install-cogment.sh
```

Download and install the latest final version using

```console
sudo ./install-cogment.sh
```

Other installation options are available using `./install-cogment.sh --help`

For futher installation options please refer to cogment's [installation guide](https://cogment.ai/docs/cogment/installation/).

### Docker image

```console
docker pull cogment/cogment
```

## Developers

This repository is organized in 3 different packages grouped the `packages` folder:

- `grpc_api` is the gRPC api, consisting of protocol buffers `.proto` definition files,
- `orchestrator` is the orchestrator library, developed in C++,
- `cli` is the _host_ executable, developed in Go, it integrates the orchestrator and includes the other services and tools.

A [CMake](https://cmake.org) based systems glues the build of both together

### Prerequisites

- Fully working **c++** build toolchain.
- Fully working **go** setup (1.16), as described in the [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- **`Cmake`** (>= 3.10), the core of the build system, it should be installed as described in the [official documentation](https://cmake.org/install/).
- **`Make`**, most flavor should work fine.
- _Optional_, **`golangci-lint`** (v1.50.1) used to run lint on the golang codebase, installed as described in the [official documentation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/).
- _Optional_, **`clang-format`** (10) used to run lint on the c++ codebase, it can be installed on most linux flavor from <https://apt.llvm.org> and on mac using `brew install clang-format`.
- _Optional_, a [**docker**](https://www.docker.com/) installation to be able to build the docker image.

### Build

At the root of the repository you'll find the following scripts:

- `build_docker.sh` builds the docker image.
- `build_linux.sh` builds the linux amd64 binary.
- `build_macos.sh` builds the macos amd64 & arm64 binaries.
- `build_windows.bat` builds the windows amd64 binary.
- `build_all_no_orchestrator.sh` builds the binary for all supported platforms (linux/amd64, macos/amd64, macos/arm64 and windows/amd64) without the embedded orchestrator.

The build results are store in the `./install` directory per platform.

Those scripts run CMake and create a build directory, per platform, in the `./build` directory. Further build target are available there, especially for testing of code formatting.

### Formatting & coding style

- `orchestrator_lint` and `orchestrator_fix_lint` respectively check and fix the code formatting of the c++ orchestrator codebase using [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
- `cli_lint` and `cli_fix_lint` respectively check and fix the code formatting of the go cli codebase using [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run)

> `./build_linux.sh lint` or `./build_macos.sh lint` can be used as a shortcut to run both linters.

### Test

- `cli_test` runs a suite of tests over the go cli codebase.

> `./build_linux.sh test` or `./build_macos.sh test` can be used as a shortcut to run tests.

### Benchmark

- `cli_benchmark` runs a suite of benchmarks over the go cli codebase.

### Release process

People having maintainers rights of the repository can follow these steps to release a version **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. The versioning scheme follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

1. Run `./scripts/create_release_branch.sh MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to create the release branch and update the version of the package,
2. On the release branch, check and update the changelog if needed,
3. Make sure everything's fine on CI,
4. Run `./scripts/tag_release.sh MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to create the specific version section in the changelog, merge the release branch in `main`, create the release tag and update the `develop` branch with those.

The rest, publishing the package to dockerhub and updating the mirror repositories, is handled directly by the CI.
